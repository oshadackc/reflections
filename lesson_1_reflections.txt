1) How did viewing a diff between 2 versions
of a file help you spot the bug?
It was helpful because diff command automatically 
highlights the differences between the files. One 
does not need to painstakingly go over each line of 
code present in the files to be compared.

2) How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Having the entire history of a file, helps you see the 
changes made to the file and the impact of each such change

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
